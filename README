* SDL_image 1.2
* PhysFS
* CMake for building


HOW TO BUILD - Linux

Underneath, Ubuntu is assumed. This probably only affects the package manager, apt-get. Please refer to the documentation of your own distro if you are not sure how to execute the following steps.
We will also assume you have the OpenNotrium source files checked out in ~/OpenNotrium

1. Install CMake
  sudo apt-get install cmake

2. Install dependencies
  sudo apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev libphysfs-dev

3. Go to the OpenNotrium source directory and create a new directory for build output
  cd ~/OpenNotrium
  mkdir build
  cd build

4. From this new directory, let cmake generate the Makefile. CMake should end with a message about build files being written. Fix any errors before continuing!
  cmake ..

5. Build OpenNotrium. This also shouldn't produce any errors. A few warnings is fine.
  make

6. You should have the executable OpenNotrium in your build directory. We will create a seperate directory from which to run the program. We also need the runtime files there.
  cd ..
  mkdir out
  cp build/OpenNotrium out
  cp -r runtime_files/* out

7. Run OpenNotrium!
  cd out
  ./OpenNotrium


HOW TO BUILD - Windows - Visual Studio

1. Install CMake
Find it from the website.

2. Build physfs
Physfs doesn't provide binaries on Windows. Google, download and unpack. Then, follow the instructions they provide in INSTALL.txt, which is mainly to use CMake.

3. Google, download and unpack, SDL 1.2, SDL_image 1.2 and SDL_mixer 1.2. Make sure to get the VS-development archives. It is highly recommended to unpack the libraries to the same directory, this helps with the next steps.

4. Create environment variables for the libraries so CMake can find them. Set the paths below to where you unpacked 
setx SDLDIR c:\sdl1.2
setx PHYSFSDIR c:\physfs

3. Create a project file using CMake
See steps 3 and 4 under the Linux howto, or use cmake-gui.

4. From this new directory, let cmake generate the Makefile. CMake should end with a message about build files being written. Fix any errors before continuing!
  cmake ..

5. Build OpenNotrium by opening the Visual Studio solution file and doing a build.

6. Create a new directory named 'out' under the OpenNotrium source folder. Copy both the executable (should be under build\Debug\OpenNotrium.exe) and the contents of runtime_files to it.

7. Search the library directories for any necessary .dll files, and copy these to the new 'out' directory. This may depend on your system, but you might want the x86 versions of:
-for physfs
physfs.dll

-for SDL
SDL.dll

-for SDL_image
SDL_image.dll
libjpeg-8.dll
libpng15-15.dll
libtiff-5.dll
libwebp-2.dll
zlib1.dll

-for SDL_mixer
SDL_mixer.dll
libFLAC-8.dll
libmikmod-2.dll
libogg-0.dll
libvorbis-0.dll
libvorbisfile-3.dll
smpeg.dll
