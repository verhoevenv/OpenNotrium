You have survived the crash intact, but the pod has been heavily damaged. The computer power lines are leaking burning fuel.

You are at the bottom of a deep gorge. It is very dark, as the steep rock faces cut off most of the sky from view. A river must have passed through here once, because the land is still very wet.

This area is quite peculiar, certainly different from the others, you see in the distance several of what appears to be an alien mining device, you're only able to tell such by the fact it seems to be extracting a liquid from the ground. You also notice crystaline ore scattering the landscape. There aren't many trees, and the air seems to ionize, making it dangerous to you. \ \ Your surroundings seem quite desolate, but the distinct sound of gunshots nearby quickly breaks any reverance you might hold. This certainly isn't the safest place to be. You wonder who is behind this whole operation, and would they help you. \ \ You see a number of metal crates in the area. To open them you will need a Welding Torch.;//enter area text, specify none to not show it

Those Ice Orbs were quite the challenge but now your mind feels more free now that they no longer clutter it. Looking ahead you can see what appears to a blob like creature made of liquid ice.

For a moment you think of escaping with the shuttle, but the shuttle is not equipped with warp drives. The only choise is to attack the marine mothership. \ \ Gladly the marines on the ground didn't have time to raise an alarm, and you fly your little shuttle to the unwary marine battleship hovering far above Notrium. The ship is huge, much bigger than the one you came here on. It must have arrived after you were shot down, since it wasn't detected at that time. \ \ If you wish to retreat back to Notrium, the shuttle is still usable.;//enter area text, specify none to not show it
