I have crash-landed on an alien world with few supplies, and with no knowledge of who shot the ship down. As I'm writing this, I have just crawled out of the only escape pod I left working. \ \ I have taken the food supplies from the pod, but I estimate I will run out in a day. I must find something edible on this hostile world before I start losing my health. \ (Right click anything you find to use it) \ \ If I run into any enemies I can simply shred them to pieces with my claws.
My hunger consumes me and my every thought. I must find sources of food. My body feels ready to change, evolve, it is time... For now if I keep myself from becoming hungry I should be able to evolve and be able to see and hunt at night. As sharp as my claws are I've got a feeling they wont be enough and I should try and surprise my prey, being stealthy will certainly be to my benefit. \ \ I managed to grab a small energy reserve on the ship, I should be able to use it to light small fires... I just need some firewood. Those fires will help me cook my food and keep my hunger at bay as well as provide me with warmth.
My race is a proud one and I am of the elite from my tribe. The time has come for me to prove my worth and evolve. I've spent my whole life waiting for this moment. Here I am trapped on this planet... \ \ This may just be my chance. A chance to prove I am the strongest among us all. I will lead my race through the galaxy like a scourge when I have escaped this planet. No race shall be able to contain our fury! They shall speak about us in hushed whispers and stir from their sleep at the thought of us. It is all so grand... It will never be if I can't find my way off this planet. My claws shall tear into a creatures hide soon, and I shall relish the fear in its eyes!

A journal log from two days before the crash... \ \ I've heard the crew talking. They all say we'll be in the Hive sector soon. I've been watching them, though I'm sure at least some of them suspect I'm on board. I'll have to be careful. I'm going to wreck all the escape pods, leaving only one for myself once I've killed the crew. \ Their Captain mumbles to himself. Seems he has plans of settling down. Wont he be disappointed when I'm done with him. Once I've escaped this ship I can start on another until I've made my way back home. I should be careful with that Medic, seems very unstable, especially the closer we've gotten to the Hive. I can hear odd noises coming from it at night, they give even me the chills. It's like its remembering something horrible from its past.

Has it been one week already? This planet is so strange, the climates here vary so much from day to night. There also appear to be sharp changes in the enviroment as if something within the planet keeps several ecosystems going at once, yet separate from each other in a sense. \ \ This is definitely the perfect hunting grounds. I can imagine the creatures here will be just as varied as the environments, and this will make the hunt that much more exciting when I catch them and kill them. The fear will start and spread out like a blossoming flower. It wont take long for my race to hear word of my exploits here. We could make this planet ours... It's just a thought, but I can't help it, the thrill of the hunt consumes me as does my conquest for domination.

That crash jarred my mind... I read past journal logs. It was one day before fate brought me here... \ \ That rotten Captain found me. The silly creature actually thought he had killed me. I knew it would pay to bring along one of my tribe. As if he could tell the difference between one creature and another. I laughed to myself as I watched the fool burn as he ran at the Captain, that look of pure utter fear in his eyes as he burnt to a crisp in a matter of seconds. Their Captain didn't even bother to look for me after that, so folly in his confidence. He wont be so confident when his rotting corpse is decorating his ship and I'll be safely away once his whole crew is dead. I even managed to catch a glimpse of something amusing. Seems that Medic slammed one of the crew against a wall, that one is strange indeed, different from the others...




My progress on this planet has been gradual, but now I feel I am truly able to survive here. My hunger does not desist, but I have learned that I am able to survive off the corpses of some creatures here by cooking them with a fire. This will provide me with steady source of food I will need. I will need to keep up the hunt always. \ \ I should seek out those like myself, they will provide me with a good source of food. I must prepare myself. I will overwhelm this planet and start my own brood. All will fear me and the sight of me will make them tremble. I will show none mercy. It will all be mine!


I can remember it so clearly now... The day I snuck onto their ship... \ \ A ship has landed at the outpost. I've seen many different creatures come and go. Some with flesh of metal, and another that had a strange glow to it and an oddly misshapen body. \ \ I've convinced one of the slower thinking males to stowaway on the ship with me. We're going to sneak aboard and kill the crew. Then when they're dead I'll dispose of him and I can start my own brood on a new planet. When I return I will make them all fear me. Their corpses will pile to the skies and I shall sit atop them in glorious reverance, of their ignorance, of how powerful I could become. This universe will come to know me and they will come to fear me!




I can almost see my tribe in my mind and recall my desires to leave them and start my own brood... \ \ It has been years and many had tried their best to rid me from the tribe. I've survived through countless attempts on my life. I am filled with anger. I no longer fear, I only wish to dominate. I know now that I will never be able to rule this brood as they would see me dead before that happened. Yet my desire to have my own brood only grows stronger. I must find another planet. A planet where I can create my own brood and spread it out, our might and cunning will be unopposed by all and they shall quake in fear at even the mention of us. I will wait... However long it takes, a ship will eventually dock at the outpost and I will make my escape to some place new.


To think of my youth is painful, but how will those I conquer know the signifigance of their deaths if I do not share my past... \ \ I was born to the name Nai' R' Nuaq. I am the runt, the smallest of all born. For my lack of strength I was not mocked as that was not the way of the brood. The weak were killed and eaten. More useful as prey than as predators. I use my guile and cunning to avoid each attempt on my life and have killed several of our brood as I strive to stay alive in this harsh reality. When I grow stronger they will learn to fear me, one way or another. My suffering will be nothing compared to their own and any that stand in my way. That stupid male is always following me around, playing my protector, someday he will serve his use to me so I let him be, for now.
