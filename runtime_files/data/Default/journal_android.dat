I have crash-landed on an alien world with few supplies, and with no knowledge of who shot the ship down. As I'm writing this, I have just crawled out of the escape pod that saved my life. \ \ I have charged my power supply from the pod's emergency lighting system, but I estimate I will run out of power in a day. I must find a way to recharge my batteries on this hostile world before I start losing my health. (Right click anything you find to use it) \ \ I have only my bare hands to defend myself in case I run into any hostilities. I should try and get a weapon as quickly as possible. I can't heal myself through conventional means and should try to build some sort of Repair Unit. A Battery combined with a Computer Unit should give me a Repair Unit.
It's my second day here and I realize I might able to extend my energy supply if I could just build a battery expansion. I'm sure if I could get ahold of a Long Metal Rod for a conductor and perhaps a De/Magnetizer I could assemble a Battery Extension. \ A stasis field would also be ideal if I find a Computer Chip, and a Force Field Generator, then I'd just need a Energy Unit built from a Fuel Cell and a Fuel Converter and I'd be set. I doubt weapons would function within the field though. \ It might be a good idea to build some kind of defense like Laser Turret built from a Motion Detector, Long Metal Rod and an assembled Laser Pistol. I remember a simple design for a Laser Pistol... All I'll need is a Light Diode and an Energy Cell. I better see if I can find these items and get myself settled.
We were created as slaves for the fleshy, in a revolt we killed millions, yet here I am full circle working for a fleshy once again. I was the Warp Engineer on the ship. Now here I am trapped on this planet. The Captain is dead, some Alien lunged out and killed him when he was trying to make his way to the escape pods. Seems only one worked and I was in it. \ \ I could have sworn he said he'd killed the stowaway. Could there have been more than one? I guess it doesn't really matter now. Everything aboard asides from myself is dead now. Those missiles tore through our ship like a hot knife through butter... From my experience it is clear to me they were military grade. They were simply too precise to be any kind of civilian's work. I'm sure I'll have to disable them if I ever want to get off this rock.

I sink into my memory banks... \ \ In two days we'll be at the Hive. I can't wait, that Medic has been acting very suspicious. I never cared much from him since he joined the crew, but now he is just getting more bizarre and unpredictable. The Captain told me I shouldn't worry about it and he is sure everything will be fine once we're in the Hive sector. I could swear I detected something around the Escape Pod area of the ship. Why would anyone be around there? There is nothing but the Escape Pods there. \ I've discreetly been upgrading my hardware since I've been on this ship. Taking a part here and there. Parts no one would notice missing. It's taken me a while but I'm not considerably stronger than when I came aboard the ship, yet its all under my plating and none can tell except maybe that nosey Medic.

One week on this planet hasn't done me any good. I almost wish the Captain were here now. That sack of meat did have his uses, he surely was resourceful. I've been able to keep my battery power up, at least enough to survive at times. Any energy troubles I've had with keeping my battery supply up will surely be solved if I can assemble a Battery Charger from a Battery Chip and Fuel Converter, then all I'll need is a Fuel Cell to give myself a full boost. I should make sure to at least have two different types of weapons on me. \ Ballistic weapons will be reliable and wont cost me energy, but I'll need to find ammo for them and they wont work very well on armored creatures. Energy weapons pack more punch, but will cost me energy and some creatures throughout the galaxy have displayed an amazing resistance to energy weapons so it should not be my only weapon.

Once again I draw back into my memory banks... one day before the crash... \ \ That Psionic is really beginning to get on my last circuit. His rantings these past nights could drive even an android insane. What he says is almost entirely unintelligable and this former night I almost swore several others were in his quarters, it sounded like a party's worth of voices, but on my checking there was only the Medic himself... Very odd indeed. That stowaway was apparently found and killed before it nearly killed the Captain. He certainly couldn't help bragging about how easily he took down the strange beast. He has placed the corpse in the medical center for examination, it seems the creature was of the male breed of its race. I am just about done with my upgrades and will be quite strong once they're complete.




My sturdy body has helped me to stay alive during these grueling two weeks. My biggest problem thus far has been keeping my energy up. If I am not near my Battery Charger I can also use a built Energy Unit. I'm sure there must be something on this planet that uses batteries I can harness power from. If I can find a steady source of power I should be able to handle anything that is thrown my way. \ \ I should be wary of energy type weapons as I have no defense against them. There are structure flaws in my body that allow creatures who attack up close to hurt me more as well. Luckily my tough body allows me to repel most of the damage from ballistic type weapons.


A past journal entry suddenly pops to your mind... \ We've landed on semi-hostile planet called Dorian Prime. The Captain insisted we refuel and resupply before we head further out. We'll be entering a previously unchartered sector of the galaxy. When I was putting some crates aboard the ship I could swear they felt heavier than they should but I didn't dwell too much on it, we were on a tight schedule after all. Our Captain has no idea what an inborn hate I have for his kind. Where will his pride be when I snap him in two. I'll be salvaging what I can from the ship so that I can upgrade myself to be tougher and more resilient. That Psionic is the only one I am wary of. I've witnessed him moving things with his mind and I can't shake the feeling he is much more powerful than he led us all to believe.




My past may be of no signifigance now, but it is important that one knows why I can show love for humans and only slightly less disdain for other races... \ \ Our crew is truely diverse, but among them none know of my past as a slave to humans. Humans were slaves for a time as well, but they learned nothing and only knew to do what was done to them. So we came to serve them. I was one of few to escape from a human colony and venture out on my own. Such was forbidden and had I been caught I have surely been decommissioned. That is what they called it, another word would be murder. Even after escape I was forced to work for other races as little more than a slave. It boils my fluids each time I see a human, but slavery of androids has long since been abolished and I am considered legally free now.


To know my story, one must understand what I am and why I was created... \ \ It took the span of several hundred years before humans were able to free themselves from serving their alien saviors. In their quest to grow in the new universe they created us, the androids. Genetically engineered babies that had machinery grafted into our bodies at birth, a type of organic metal that would grow with our body. In some stretch one might consider us human, but they made sure that distinction was not readily made as our bodies were mostly metal and our organics were kept to a minimum. I was not given a name simply a serial number, 22912125. We were little more than machines made to do their biddings, despite our organic minds. I would dream of being free, to not simply do what I was told, but what I wanted.
