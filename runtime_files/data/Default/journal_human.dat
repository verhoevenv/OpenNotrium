I have crash-landed on an alien world with few supplies, and with no knowledge of who shot my ship down. As I'm writing this, I have just crawled out of the escape pod that saved my life. \ \ I have taken the food supplies from the pod, but I estimate I will run out in a day. I must find something edible on this hostile world before I start losing my health. \ (Right click anything you find to use it) \ \ I have only my bare hands to defend myself with if I run into any hostilities. I should try and get a weapon as quickly as possible.
I should definitely build a Working Subspace Radio. I found a Subspace Radio from the pod, all I need is a Long Metal Rod and a Computer Chip. This should help me find the other items I'll need for my survival. \ \ I need to build up an arsenal of weapons. Who knows what kinds of aliens live in this hell hole? \ \ A simple shelter is going to make my life here a whole lot easier. From my training I remember learning the simple construction for a Stasis Field Generator. I should see if I can find the parts, a Force Field Generator, an Energy Unit and a Computer Unit.
One might think my days at the academy had trained me for a situation like this. The truth is, nothing can prepare you for a planet like this. This planet seems so foreign, yet so familiar. I can't help like feeling a certain familiarity with it, yet so lost at the same time. If I die tomorrow from starvation or eaten by some hungry creature... let it be known I led a full life. I should really get going now... \ \ I think staying in one place for too long on this planet without the proper defenses... A laser turret perhaps, it wouldn't be very wise and a good way to invite trouble. I've heard noises at night, scratching along the ground, rustles through the leaves... I only hope they don't hear me and ignore my presence for just a little longer.

You examine your past journal logs... \ \ In two days I'll be at the Hive. This sector of the galaxy is shrouded in mystery. Little is known about it, but I can't help but feel a bit anxious. This trip could be quite lucrative for me. I've heard of a large source of a rare Crystalline Ore there. It certainly would be nice to retire and have the wealth to make your home where you wished. I might even find a nice planet in the sector to settle down in. Well I shouldn't think too much on it... I've got duties to perform and the crew have told to me about a possible stowaway on the ship. I should investigate this immediately. The Medic on our ship has also been acting strange the closer we get to the Hive system and seems highly suspicious of our Warp Engineer. He also tells me of vivid nightmares he's been having. Well I'm sure things will get better once we get into the Hive System.

I can't believe it. I've survived one whole earth week here. This place is certainly not any kind of safe haven. How did I ever humor the idea of living in this system. It seems as if everything I meet wants me dead! My crew has been dead now for over a week. Whenever I close my eyes their screams haunt me... \ \ Only one of us was going to make it to the escape pod, only one still worked... My emotions churn inside of me for leaving them behind. I shouldn't think such things. They knew I was the Captain... and it was my duty to get off the ship first. The other escape pods never fired... That Alien must've done something to the other escape pods before I found and killed it.

You examine a previous journal log... That day before the crash... \ \ Things have only gotten more strange as we get closer to the Hive. Our Medic has indeed been acting very strange, almost violently towards the rest of the crew as we are less than a day from entering the Hive. Today he slammed one of the crew members against the wall with his mind alone. \ I found the stowaway near the escape pods. Apparently it's some kind of predatorial Alien and had gotten aboard on one of our stops. Lucky for me I had a flame thrower on me and made short work of it. Its eyes creeped me out, it was clear we all would have been dead had I not taken care of the Alien first. I've informed the crew that the lurker has been killed and they all seem more or less happy, though for the most part they think I'm boasting a bit. Perhaps I am... It just seemed too easy.




I've been here for what seems to be two weeks time. My mind grows hazy and I find it more difficult to distinguish reality from that which is not real. Something bothers me... How did an advanced defense system end up on this planet? It seems far too familiar and human, those missiles were definitely not alien. On the initial scans of the planet we did pick up high concentrations of Cystaline Ore in one region of the planet, perhaps I will find my answers there if I can find this region. \ If I am right I should be very careful when I go to this region as it will no doubt be swarming with whomever caused my ship to crash in the first place. Going in unarmed will no doubt be unwise. Despite the danger I'm sure this region will also possess some means of my escape and perhaps means to prolong my survival as well. I just hope the gains outweight the risks...


In your exhaustion you read more past journal entries... \ We've landed on a lesser known planet called Dorian Prime. The natural inhabitants of this planet I hear are quite feral and have been known to attack unwelcomed guests. I want to refuel and resupply as quickly as possible so we don't end up with any casualities. \ \ That Psionic has been with us for a while now and has proved invaluable as a Medic to the crew. He seems to have a knack for it and seems to be getting along quite well with all the crew except for the Android. Those two definately do not care much for each other. I'll have to keep a close eye on them both. The last thing I need is for my crew to be fighting each other. These times are far to dangerous for us to be at each other's throats.




It was years ago now... \ \ I had trained at one the premier acadamies and had earned enough to pay for my very own ship, the Var' Equinallin. The name must seem odd to others but it has meaning to me, eventually in time others will come to understand where it came from as well. \ \ I'll be leaving the port at the academy soon. My job now is to find a crew to man my ship, although the term man just doesn't seem appropriate anymore. We've become so rare, humans that is, that I am sure my crew will be composed of a mish mosh of races from all over the universe. I just hope my dreams don't end in my death on some far off planet no one has ever heard of. Well... I shouldn't think of things like that I'll simply jinx myself and it's time for me to go now as my ship is being cleared for launch.


It's been so long, but my past seems worth mentioning in this journal. If I die and someone finds this journal, I can at least tell them where I came from and why I ultimately arrived here... \ \ My home was the violently destroyed planet of Earth. I have spent a lifetime in search for the ones responsible. \ \ After founding a colony with some of the survivors, I joined the interstellar exploration fleet in hopes of somehow finding the prey I seek. The latest trace lead me to Notrium, but there is nothing to be found here. Only death.
