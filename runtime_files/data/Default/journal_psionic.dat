I managed to get into the escape pod and safely guide it down to the planet. Now I'm stranded on this oddly familiar planet. As I'm writing this, I have just crawled out of the escape pod that saved my life. \ \ Thankfully my rigorous mental training prevents me from starving quickly. My body is weak so I will have to be wary of any dangers. \ (Right click anything you find to use it) \ \ Ingrained in my mind are Psionic Tokens which help me focus my abilities. I recall a couple of token combinations. To make a blast with my mind I'll need to combine a Mass with a Motion Token and then with a Heat Token. To create a fire I will need to integrate a Heat Token with a Mass Token. I don't recall the third, but I'm sure it will come to me.
I recall 3 Psionic Tokens. \ The Motion Token will be useful in itself as it can be used to tell me when creatures are nearby me, allowing me to travel more carefully and not arouse the suspicion of hostile creatures to my presence. I'll have to keep in mind that such a useful ability will be draining on my energy. \ The Mass Token will be invaluable to me, allowing me to extract Life Essence from the red Healing Plants I've seen on this planet by using the Mass Token near a Healing Plant. I can regain the health I lose by eating the plant. \ The last token I possess is the Heat Token which will allow me to warm myself and keep from freezing.
I know very little of my past, only that I was not like the rest of my race and that Psionic powers come naturally to me. Now I find myself stranded on a planet that seems eerily familiar. I've seen this place in my dreams. Somehow I am haunted by everything I see here. I may just find the answers to who I am and more importantly where I came from in this strange yet oddly comforting place. \ \ I've felt odd ever since we entered the Hive sector and now I can finally find out why. Everyone aboard the ship is dead now. I managed to make it to the escape pod in time. There were other pods, but none besides my own fired from the ship. Something must have happened to them or perhaps the others never made it to their escape pods... I will never really know. So long as I am careful and patient I am sure I will be able to overcome any obstacle I encounter.

As I delve into my mind for meditation it drifts back... Two days prior to the crash on Notrium... \ \ The Captain informed me today that we're just two days away from entering the Hive Sector. As we near the sector I begin to have strange nightmares, so vivid it is almost as if they are memories. I see a race that looks much like myself holding up a strange sphere resembling a planet in everywhere, a miniature version of one at least. I can hear them chanting in their minds. A strange light blinds them and then screams fill their minds, screams of rage and fear. I've shared these dreams with the Captain and he simply assures me everything will work itself out once we're there. I'm suspicious of the Warp Engineer, I detect him in areas of the ship he should not be and notice slight changes in him as if he has been upgrading himself.

I feel more aware of the planet now that one week has passed, as if in some strange way I am a part of it. Things grow more and more familiar and I feel as if I have come home. While I can see there are many dangers I can also see there is also a safe haven for me somewhere on this planet, a place filled with living plants and growing plant life. I feel as if none would harm me in this place and it may hold within the answer to who I am and where I came from. \ \ I am getting ever closer and my mind is becoming clearer. I shall continue to focus on improving my abilities so that I can unlock the mysteries on this strange planet. Perhaps I will find others like myself. I see a temple in my mind, hidden within this safe haven of mine. The answers must lie there. A glimpse of my past... of my race's past.

I feel a sharp pain within my head... My mind is being wrenched back into the past... One day before the crash... \ The nightmares have only gotten worse and more vivid. The race seems to have changed, turning into plant creatures. Their heads changing into vines that can no longer see. They all seem so fearful, yet angry as well. Oddly I do not fear them, but what has happened to them in my dream causes great relief in me as if I somehow avoided their fate. \ After I had awoken a ship mate made a jest at me. The kind you'd expect from such a mixed crew. I was simply not in the mood for it and slammed him against the wall with my mind alone. The Captain certainly wasn't happy about it. I doubt that crew member will be bothering me again either way. That Android is definately up to something and seems to be keeping a close eye on me as well.




While my body is weak I have grown stronger, I've proven to be more sturdy than I ever imagined. I never thought I could survive this long on my own... two whole weeks on this strangely familiar planet. \ \ When I crashed down in the escape pod I noticed a building had once stood where the wreckage of my Escape Pod now lay. It looks as if it was of some importance. Perhaps I can find something if I scour it. There may be something I can gleam that will help further my journey of self discovery. \ \ I am confident that if I'm careful and use what I have learned that I will find the answers I seek. For now I should search the crash site, there may be a hidden entry I initially missed when I first arrived.


Sometimes the past becomes more clear than the present. It's as if my mind can't hold on to what is happening now. I can feel my past tugging at me, beckoning me back again... \ \ We've just landed on Dorian Prime, home to a vicious race of predatorial creatures. I told the Captain of my uneasiness and he assures me this is routine and we wont be here long enough to worry about. I still feel uncomfortable, as if the forest has eyes. The Android seemed to have some trouble with a couple of crates he loaded onto the ship. I could almost sense something from within them but I said nothing. I'm sure it was just my imagination playing tricks on me. I get shivers everytime I look into the mass of jungles that surround the outpost. After a brief talk with the Captain he sent me back to the ship, his reason being he didn't want me to worry the crew with my delusions.




I wish I could recall my past but it is so muddled. The dreams still come but they're so vague and unclear that I learn little from them. I do now realize that I am the last of my race and that something horrible happened in my race's past. If I could only find out what happened to them I could perhaps find a way to bring them back. I suspect that my descendants are here, but different... \ \ I feel so very lost... Though I am home, so much has changed and things may never return to how they once were. I must keep hope alive and strive to bring the past back into the present. I never cared for the human, but were it not for our captain I would have never discovered where I came from. Though my mind is like one large jigsaw puzzle the pieces are slowly coming together.


My body burns hot, a flash of my past played before me like an incredibly vivid dream. \ \ I am standing in a village surrounded by those around me. We are going to war. They speak of a race of plant like creatures that have come to our planet. Our planet becoming overgrown with strange plants the longer they stay. \ \ Many died in the war, but we won. They were not finished however and in the final battle we suffered a horrible fate as our leader grasped a orb that was dropped, it appeared to be our planet, he gazed into it curiously as it began to glow. As I saw it began to glow I ran away as fast, fear filling me as the others just stared at it, entranced. I heard the shrieks as they changed and degenerated into strange plants! I quickly opened a portal into the void, losing all memory of what happened that day. I must find this orb!
