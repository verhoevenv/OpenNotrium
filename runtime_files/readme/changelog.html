    <LI>The hoverbike now works for the
    alien player</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Repair Unit is no longer a weilded
    item. It had to be done since you can't do a weild on an item use
    basis, it works for the whole item no matter how many various uses
    it has. This shouldn't present a large problem and makes the Android
    actually able to heal and it can still be used as a weapon.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed the text for the Repair Unit
    so it clearly tells how to heal the Android with it.</LI>
    <LI>Lowered amount of Insectoid in
    Dried Up Marsh Area.</LI>
    <LI>Added in 3 sub shots for the
    Psionic Blast's Explosion so there is no loop but the damage is
    still good if it hits right.</LI>
    <LI>Removed Void Token from start area
    of Void Dreamscape.</LI>
    <LI>Adjusted Fire's light intensity to
    2.0. It not only takes 3 fires max to make a pitch dark area lit up
    well enough to make most things out. It's alot closer to 1.2 in my
    opinion now.</LI>
    <LI>Adjusted the Flashlight's light
    intensity as well so it worked closer to the 1.2 version and shows a
    tapered light radius rather than such an intense focus. Makes it
    alot more useful but still not as useful as goggles.</LI>
    <LI>Tweaked Psionic's Blast so it
    looks graphically better as it starts out as a spread and shrinks in
    to a single shot. The most damage is done if you hit with the full
    spread at once naturally. The explosion looks nicer now as well.</LI>
    <LI>Replaced many of the Shock Trooper
    Marines with Marine Infantry. I just didn't see the point in having
    two very hard to kill creatures guard some items. They should still
    provide a decent challenge.</LI>
    <LI>Moved Reaper Spawner onto a map
    border in Dried Up Marsh so it wouldn't be such an annoyance and you
    can't see exactly where they're coming from like before.</LI>
    <LI>Tweaked Beacon Ray to use the new
    weapon effect so it has a nice spread now.</LI>
    <LI>New turret, Machine Gun Turret, at
    the point where you'd normally add a laser pistol to make a laser
    turret you simply add a rapid fire pistol instead.</LI>
    <LI>Pulse Laser is now made by
    combining a Glass Marble with a Laser Pistol. Makes a bit more sense
    to me. It hints at it in the first pickup text but it isn't
    mentioned in the short description.</LI>
    <LI>Alien is immune to Acid Rain once
    it has gone through its second evolution.</LI>
    <LI>Tweaked the punch and pummel.
    Pummel now propels the Android forward and actually smacks enemies
    back now. Human's punch was just enhanced to push back creatures a
    bit. Test them both and see if they feel comfortable. Android's
    punch does take some skill to use properly, which is fine, since
    it's a pretty powerful move to start with.</LI>

Ville:
<UL>
    <LI>New effect: 59, use an item from
    the player's inventory. One limitation is that if the item is a
    slotted item and the slots are already taken, the item cannot be
    used.</LI>
    <LI>You should no longer be able to
    shoot through any walls</LI>
    <LI>Fixed condition 35, the distance
    wasn't calculated from the center of the item</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a crash that happened if a
    creature would die under some very rare conditions</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug with friendly creatures
    that caused them to remain put after killing a creature</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug that caused friendly
    creatures to push you</LI>
    <LI>Fixed camera spinning wildly on
    low framerates</LI>
    <LI>Fixed long standing bug with
    journals sometimes crashing</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug with multiple mod's race
    ragdoll pictures</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug with animated objects
    looking wrong on entering an area</LI>
    <LI>It's no longer necessary to place
    isolated areas to map.dat</LI>
    <LI>Modified the follow friend AI
    mode, followers now attack enemies they see are too close to the
    friend. Modified the player's friendly creature's AI to make them
    less prone to go on lone hunts.</LI>
    <LI>Made the weapon 0 a &quot;no
    weapon&quot;, it must not be removed. Creatures will not attack a
    creature that wields weapon 0, thus creatures will avoid containers
    and barriers.</LI>
    <LI>Updated tutorial</LI>
    <LI>The generators are now items
    insted of plot_objects. They cannot be broken up anymore.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug with fires not warming
    you.</LI>
    <LI>Set the marine's death animation
    speed slower.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed the stasis field.</LI>
    <LI>Made batteries appear randomly on
    the map if you're playing the android.</LI>
    <LI>The bar texture is now defineable
    per bar.</LI>
    <LI>Spawners to the Hive. There's now
    an infinite supply of enemies to kill!</LI>
    <LI>Positioned the Hive so that you
    have to get to the other side of the river at some point of the
    game.</LI>
    <LI>Hoverbike</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Two syntax errors fixed. One in
    animations.dat and the other in climate_types.dat.</LI>
    <LI>Alien can now lay eggs in its
    final evolution. Everything is explained within the items. The Alien
    can lay two eggs and both are much better than the egg you get from
    the Alien Hive. (Use Devour to get your food up quickly so you can
    lay eggs. Remember to save some Small Blue Alien Corpses to feed to
    the larva you hatch.)</LI>
    <LI>Alien can create its own nest
    which is used to hatch its special eggs. The nest must be used on a
    Swamp terrain to be laid down.</LI>
    <LI>The eggs you find in the Hive can
    be hatch in either the large nest they came from as before. As a
    second option available to only the Alien, they can be hatched in
    one of her nests. Every other race 'has to' hatch the eggs in the
    big nests as the other races can't create nests of their own like
    the Alien.</LI>
    <LI>Pet Alien from the Hive only takes
    1 Brown Alien to cacoon and 2 to become fully mature once it is a
    Small Pet Alien. It is the weakest of the Alien's that can be
    hatched, but easiest as well, especially for the Alien since it can
    make its nest out of the Hive which makes raising it considerably
    easier.</LI>
    <LI>Journal for Human and Android now
    reflect the fact you do not start with the Tazor anymore. It also
    encourages you to find a weapon.</LI>
    <LI>Android can no longer eat any of
    the Fungus good or bad.</LI>
    <LI>The Tentacle in the Lifeforce
    Dreamscape will no longer tell you to put on or take off the Psionic
    Armor.</LI>
    <LI>Filler Area was replaced with
    Dried Up Marsh. It's mostly scenic but some items were strategically
    hidden under a couple of trees. Two Broken Turrets, a Powered
    Accelerator and 6 boxes of Bullets. This is not including what the
    game randomly places into the area on its own. The secondary purpose
    of the area is to be used as a spot to place its nest at since at
    the center there will be marsh terrain.</LI>
    <LI>Repair Unit now vanishes when you
    use it to repair you with the Y key.</LI>
    <LI>Combination to turn a Broken
    Turret into a Laser Turret when you combine it with a Repair Unit
    has been restored. Not sure really at what point it was removed, but
    its back now.</LI>
    <LI>Lifeforce Dreamscape is complete.
    Test it thoroughly. You need to go to the Green Altar to get there.</LI>
    <LI>Forcefields were added to the
    bunker to keep the Small Blue Aliens contained.</LI>
    <LI>Stasis Field 'should' stop bullets
    now.</LI>
    <LI>Can't believe I forgot to mention
    the Repair Unit for the Android in it's journal. Well it's there now
    in the very first entry and it even tells you what you need to make
    one. I also noted it in the Android's description when you pick it
    as a race in the menu.</LI>
    <LI>All Ally creatures should have a
    green dot on your radar.</LI>
    <LI>The various Alien types have
    different radar signatures making it possible to distinguish what
    each color and size represents. This is 'only' for the Aliens, hence
    blue, brown, reaper. The rest simply show as the normal grey dots.
    This should make hunting specific alien types alot easier once you
    have some way of detecting them.</LI>
    <LI>Void Dreamscape is complete. Test
    it thoroughly. You enter it through the Space Distortion in Mining
    Area.</LI>
    <LI>Human and Android now have their
    own starting melee attack. Human has Punch which costs 0.5 food to
    swing and 0.5 health when it hits. Android has Pummel which hurts
    more and knocks back more and only costs it 0.5 energy to swing, but
    its almost 3 times slower than the human's swing. 
    </LI>
    <LI>Punch and Pummel now only use one
    hand slot so you can carry a flashlight when punching or pummeling.
    This was done because no one seemed to like it being two-handed.</LI>
    <LI>Fire Extinguisher now uses itself
    as ammo. You get 200 blasts and once they're gone that is it. This
    should keep it from invalidating the Tazor.</LI>
    <LI>Script 56 &amp; 57 are in place to
    hide the Time Distortion Bar when it isn't in use, IE below 1. The
    Show bar effect needs to be tweaked for it to work I believe. Either
    way those scripts are in place and just need to be fixed so they
    work.</LI>
    <LI>You can now pick up all the
    turrets including the tentacle. The larva and baby versions of all
    the pets can be picked up as well. You use V Key to pick up
    creatures. All races can do this. Faster races carry with less
    effort.</LI>
    <LI>Eden's lighting was adjusted so it
    is fairly bright there during the day and very mildly dark at night.
    So you can always see in Eden even without a light source. The
    length of the day cycle is the normal length of 200 seconds.</LI>
    <LI>Player Races now drain excess food
    over their max noticably faster to drain off the excess till they
    are just at the max.</LI>

    <LI>Made all the bigger weapons use
    two hands</LI>
    <LI>Toned down the marine's weapons
    considerably. I decided that dying from four shots was ridiculous

    and no longer shoves you around.</LI>
    <LI>Effects/Conditions have been
    removed from the data files and now are inside the Notes.txt file
    only, so update that from now on. [This is mainly of note to Ville]</LI>
    <LI>Entry texts were added for each
    section of the Liquid Dreamscape. Read them.</LI>
    <LI>Player now needs to be near the
    Water Formation in the Ship Graveyard to go to the Liquid
    Dreamscape. Does not need to be cold anymore. Water Formation is
    randomly placed within that area. Player also warps back to the
    Water Formation when they are ready to leave the Liquid Dreamscape
    after obtaining the token.</LI>
    <LI>All unfinished Dreamscapes will
    warp back to the Ancient Runes for now. Currently Lifeforce and Void
    are unfinished.</LI>
    <LI>Rain in Eden once again tweaked.
    It's still slow but you still gain health at a noticable amount. It
    is meant to take you a while to get back a large amount of health so
    I'm not going to adjust it again.</LI>
    <LI>Tazor now does no damage, but a
    second stun will not unstun the creature anymore.</LI>
    <LI>It wasn't noted before possibly
    but the Acid Spit and Lethal Bite the Alien gains are both silent
    attacks.</LI>
    <LI>Psionic Decoy now sends out a
    burst of Psionic Blasts upon its death.</LI>
    <LI>All inhabitants except the boss of
    the Lifeforce Dreamscape are ready. The area itself is still
    incomplete. You still simply go there and just grab the token for
    now.</LI>
    <LI>Journals now go to day 17 for each
    race. The journal entries are on Day 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 17.</LI>
    <LI>Sniper Pistol is silenced
    automatically. Sound IS NOT adjusted yet.</LI>
    <LI>Liquid Token was removed from your
    starting items as a Psionic, you now have to earn it. You were not
    supposed to have it before, I simply forgot to remove it once I was
    done testing.</LI>
    <LI>Dreamscapes don't wrap around
    anymore.</LI>

Ville:
<UL>
    <LI>Player race pictures are now
    visible in new game menu</LI>
    <LI>Ability to continue last saved
    game quickly when starting the game</LI>
    <LI>Save games can now be named</LI>
    <LI>Creatures that are behind walls
    are no longer visible</LI>
    <LI>The AI doesn't see the player
    behind walls anymore. It can still hear the player, and see any of
    the player's companions behind walls.</LI>
    <LI>All bullets now stop to certain
    walls. You can specify whether a wall stops bullets or not. This
    should be used sparingly, as it can slow the game down a lot.</LI>
    <LI>A weapon is no longer
    automatically selected in the beginning of the game.</LI>
    <LI>The pod now gets damage from
    missiles every time they hit.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug that caused area
    number 2 to vanish.</LI>
    <LI>Psionic's light will now not
    appear when flying the escape pod.</LI>
    <LI>New options for scripting: call
    position and calling creature.</LI>
    <LI>Start area now has a short quest
    to give the hermit the radio. Psionic has no choise but to kill him.</LI>
    <LI>The effect 19 (drop plot_object)
    now takes a size, may have broken some effects that use it.</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Added back in Large Tree with
    Pistol Chassis under it.</LI>
    <LI>Sped up both the missles and the
    Escape Pod in the beginning sequence. It's not really harder, but it
    is more interesting. You actually feel more like you're barreling
    towards the planet.. rather than slowly coasting to it at a very
    comfortable pace.</LI>
    <LI>All Dreamscapes wrap around now.
    You can only move to another section by meeting the requirements of
    that particular section.</LI>
    <LI>The 3 Alien attacks are now
    slotted. Claws to both Hand Slots, Acid Spit and Lethal Bite to Head
    Slot.</LI>
    <LI>Tweaked the temperature overall
    and all the races. Everything to do with the weather was toned down
    to make Notrium less infuriating and slightly more accomodating.
    Human's hunger was reduced from 0.9 to 0.5 making the Alien have a
    noticably faster food drain though it was not changed and remains at
    1.0 [Try out each race and make sure they feel comfortable and do
    not require further tweaking.]</LI>
    <LI>Made it so Fire Extinguisher works
    for Psionic.</LI>
    <LI>Psionic does not get any salvage
    from destroying computers. He does not need them anyways.</LI>
    <LI>Liquid Dreamscape areas/challenges
    are now in place. May need tweaking. Feedback is appreciated. You
    must beat the Psionic's doppleganger to gain the token now.</LI>
    <LI>Start of Lifeforce Mindscape has
    begun, it is not yet complete but the first creature is in the area
    where you pick up your Lifeforce Token. It needs to be frozen first
    with Psionic Chill, than it can be killed with Psionic Blast, this
    will not do anything for you yet.</LI>
    <LI>Alien's Final Evolution is in
    place. You cannot lay eggs just yet, but you can earn the final
    evolution and gain Distant Detect which should allow you to see
    every creature on nearly every map. You simply need to stay in the
    Hive Area to gain the final evolution for roughly 3 game days.</LI>

Ville:
<UL>
    <LI>Area names are now shown on the
    minimap</LI>
    <LI>Fixed the bug where the radar
    might have a random picture underneath it</LI>
    <LI>Killed by creature death block bug
    fixed?</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 48=this creature picks
    up creature</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 49=attach camera</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 50=player controls
    creature (player creature is controlled by AI while uncontrolled)</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 51=other creature
    picks up this creature</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 52=change inventory,
    the player has 10 inventories, you can change which one is active at
    a time. This is very untested, and I'm not sure how it works. The
    effect should also disable all equipped items.</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 53=continuously
    increase bar parameter3 by parameter1 for time parameter4 with
    creature visual effect from weapon parameter2, cap at maximum</LI>
    <LI>New effect: 54=make creature
    vanish for time parameter1 milliseconds</LI>
    <LI>Enemy creatures now wait a moment
    before following the player to a new area.</LI>
    <LI>Camera will now follow the target
    smoothly.</LI>
    <LI>Radar map now shows terrain as
    well.</LI>
    <LI>Radar map is now scaled correctly.</LI>
    <LI>Support for landmines, you can now
    set bullet speed to 0.</LI>
    <LI>New item property: Wielded item
    disabling script. This script is only checked for conditions, and if
    they are not met, the item is unwielded.</LI>
    <LI>Changed ordering of terrain frames
    to support Jan's editor.</LI>
    <LI>The dots on the radar can now be
    defined per item, plot_object and creature.</LI>
    <LI>More defineable options for item
    combinations.</LI>
    <LI>Areas can now wrap into
    themselves.</LI>
    <LI>New AI mode: 6=fire constantly in
    random directions</LI>
    <LI>Creatures can now have a minimum
    movement speed, should be great for flying things.</LI>
    <LI>The AI see angle is now defineable</LI>
    <LI>I've included items 185, 186 and
    187 for testing purposes. The first allows you to use any creature
    as a vehicle, there is also a script connected to this that unwields
    the item when your vehicle is destroyed. The other two show how to
    change inventories. I suggest leaving the vehicle item and replacing
    it with a real vehicle item later, but the other two can go as soon
    as you've seen how they work.</LI>
    <LI>You can now fly the escape pod in
    the beginning. Any ideas on making this more fun would be highly
    appreciated.</LI>
    <LI>Also added some stuff to do inside
    the escape pod.</LI>
    <LI>Changed the way sounds are played.
    Now if a sound is already playing, the game doesn't try to stop it
    and replay it. This should help for situations where sound cracles
    when there are many sounds playing at once, like near a fire.</LI>
    <LI>I changed the generator chips and
    the radio to come from putting out the computers in the escape pod.
    We should get rid of the emergency container. 
    </LI>
    <LI>I changed the flashlight to be
    given from player_races.dat. The alien and the psionic don't get it.</LI>
    <LI>Journal by default no longer
    starts when the game begins. If a modder wants to start the journal
    on beginning, he should use the new effect.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug where you could no
    longer return from the menu after viewing an ingame animation.</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Removed Tabs from the presets for
    the creature blocks. This was probably going to cause some modders
    pure hell if I forgot it in another update since Notrium doesn't
    like Tabs in the data files, they will crash it.</LI>
    <LI>Flashlight was dimmed. Psionic's
    light was brightened a bit.</LI>
    <LI>Corrected improper identifier
    numbering in Scripts.dat file.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed the rain in the lava random
    area. It was giving health instead of taking it away.</LI>
    <LI>Reduced the amount of healing you
    get per second in Eden drastically. You now have to camp there for a
    bit to get health back and it'll take a while if you're gravely
    injured, making it that much more risky.</LI>
    <LI>Attack Tactic was tweaked.
    Creatures that are aggressive should now be reasonably intelligent
    but not insanely so to where they stalk you forever. This makes
    running away a much more viable option.</LI>
    <LI>Adjustments were made to nearly
    all the Climate types that had drastic heat and cold variations. I
    toned down the desert and tundra climates because they were way too
    drastic. It was beyond realism, it was annoying to cook or freeze to
    death in a matter of seconds. Making it far too much of a trial to
    visit those areas.</LI>
    <LI>I've changed somethings of note
    with the creatures.dat file. The Alien is now referred to as the
    Stowaway. The Android is now referred to as the Warp Engineer.</LI>
    <LI>Feral Rage is now only usable
    through the 'R' Quick Key. This is planned to stay this way. 
    </LI>
    <LI>The journals are rewritten and
    reformated for each race. They only go up to the ninth day. Please
    view them all as they are all linked to one another. Point out
    things that don't match up if you find any. You'll find the first 3
    days to be mostly hints with the 3rd being a more direct
    introduction to the character. Day 5 and 9 are both Flashbacks and
    Day 7 is a week landmark and provides additional hints. 
    </LI>
    <LI>The Motion Token now drains energy
    when used and uses the Head Slot.</LI>
    <LI>Utility Slot added for
    Human/Android in upper right hand corner.</LI>
    <LI>Modded Subspace Radio and Biomass
    Detector now use the Utility Slot and will drain 0.5 energy per
    second when used.</LI>
    <LI>Added in the terrain map and
    entries in each of the other files for the new Bunker area that will
    be in the Ville Corp Area. (You can do a walkthrough of the area by
    changing the start area to 12 for whatever race you want to walk
    through it with. Just make sure to change it back to what it
    originally was.)</LI>
    <LI>Fixed it so the kills don't show
    in the inventory anymore. They should of vanished almost right away,
    but going into the inventory the moment you got the kill 'would'
    allow you to view them, but they wont show at all now.</LI>
    <LI>Acid Spit's stun time and its
    range were increased. The range to 300 and the time to 2 seconds.</LI>
    <LI>Bunker Exterior was added to
    Mining Area (previously known as Ville Corp Area), landing pad was
    also placed with the map editor instead of through the plot object
    data file. The area around both objects was teired off by grass to
    make it stand out a bit. No random objects should appear inside of
    the boundaries of the grass.</LI>
</UL>
25.06.2004<BR />
Ville:
<UL>
    <LI>Added dialogs.dat and an
    effect/condition pair to use it.</LI>
    <LI>The game should no longer crash
    when you try to equip a weapon on the paperdoll while already
    wielding a weapon.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug which caused crashes
    when using items. Keep a lookout for item using crashes.</LI>
    <LI>The AI should now notice you
    better if you're carrying a light.</LI>
    <LI>The melee AI will now avoid your
    shots like they used to in 1.2. This will make them considerably
    harder, so the enemy difficulty may need to be retuned.</LI>
    <LI>Changed area placement to happen
    by area classes. I've changed all the isolated areas to area class
    2, and placed an extra row for them in map.dat.</LI>
    <LI>Fixed bug which caused the game to
    crash if you didn't use a rectangular area map.</LI>
    <LI>You can now specify whether
    terrain types get random objects on top of them. This should fix the
    problem where aliens ended up on lava in the Hive area.</LI>
    <LI>Lowered the health increasing rain
    of eden to one third effect.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define a time after
    which plot_objects will be deleted</LI>
    <LI>I moved the descriptions for the
    specialties in player_races.dat to a separate line. This way they
    don't vanish in Jan's editor.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define whether a
    player_race is visible in the start menu. The first race must always
    be visible.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define the creature
    movement change speed. Should work great for vehicles and flyers.</LI>
    <LI>Changed the way the player's
    turning is done. Now it takes turn speed into account.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define a background
    image for bars. This should be used for a digital clock. I was
    hoping to put in a clock with hands, but it proved too troublesome.</LI>
    <LI>You can now change the layer the
    creature is drawn. 0 is where dead creatures are, 1 is normal, and 2
    is flying creatures.</LI>
    <LI>You can now change whether the
    creature's bars are visible when player hovers mouse over it.</LI>
    <LI>You can now change the creature's
    death animation speed</LI>
    <LI>You can now change whether a
    creature can follow a player from an area to another</LI>
    <LI>You can now define the AI see and
    hear ranges. If the AI sees or hears an enemy, the anger level is
    increased.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define a weapon's AI
    hear volume. Silent weapons don't aggravate enemies.</LI>
    <LI>See if the lethal bite weapon
    still is bugged. If it is, press numpad + to show the debugging
    variables. Report the phases of the first number, it is supposed to
    be 3000 when the weapons is fired, then reduce to a small negative
    number. You should not be able to fire the weapon before it is
    negative. It is supposed to reduce by time, so if it seems to skip
    or go way below negative, tell me.</LI>
    <LI>You can now change the random
    object density of areas. This way you can disable random item
    placement altogether from areas while adding denser areas.</LI>
    <LI>New condition: check amount of
    creatures of type in current area</LI>
    <LI>You can now define the sound
    effect for weapons that create visual effects (the effects that are
    shown on a creature when it is hit). The sound is played when the
    particle is fired. I've set all to none, so you might want to set at
    least the tazor type weapons to have the zapping sound.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define various
    footstep-related things in terrain_types.dat</LI>
    <LI>You can now define animations for
    terrain. I've tested this with lava. I believe it could be used to
    finally make water.</LI>
    <LI>You can now define animations for
    props/plot_objects. I tested this with a tree, and it looked
    incredibly stupid.</LI>
    <LI>Notrium now loads textures only
    when needed. This should reduce memory usage considerably, and speed
    up new game starting/loading.</LI>
    <LI>The interface texture computer.tga
    can now be changed from player_races.dat</LI>
    <LI>A modder can now use their own
    itemview.tga and slider.tga by placing their own versions by the
    same name in the mod directory.</LI>
    <LI>I already started with the escape
    pod interiors, they need to be finished</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Psionic can no longer drop Psionic
    Specific Items.</LI>
    <LI>Alien can no longer drop Alien
    Specific Items.</LI>
    <LI>You now should only get credit for
    an a Small Blue Alien's kill if you get the killing hit.</LI>
    <LI>Ether can now be spilled by the
    container amount to create an Ether blob which can be ignited as a
    defense. Once ignited it dies a minute later automatically.</LI>
    <LI>Tazor and VC Stun Tazor are now in
    the Stun Class instead of Energy. It was my oversight. You should
    have no problem stunning the creatures in the Eden area now.</LI>
    <LI>I added by the Pistol Chassis
    since I 'do' want it available as a start item. It is not in clear
    view. It's hidden under a large tree to the north of your crash
    site. It will always be in that same spot since it's placed with the
    map editor.</LI>
    <LI>Made Adjustments to Hot and Cold
    Strokes.</LI>
    <LI>Time Distortion for Psionic no
    longer loses its speed advantage if you're hit.</LI>
    <LI>Removed a script and replaced what
    it did in the creatures.dat file. You can only get rewarded for
    killing the small blue alien when you're within a specific range in
    your evolution as the Alien. Previously I was deleting the corpses
    before you reached a certain evolution point and they would still be
    counted later, which I didn't want.</LI>
    <LI>Explosive was changed to thrown
    and is used for the pebbles.</LI>
    <LI>Human now has a throw animation
    for when he throws pebbles or any other thrown weapon.</LI>
    <LI>Bug for Turrets not firing fixed.
    No AI controlled creatures should have weild conditions for their
    weapons.</LI>
    <LI>Aliens now have a lower chance of
    hunting the opposite breed when fed a corpse, if it is still too
    often I'll make it higher. 10 % chance for Blue and Brown to change
    and 5 % chance for the Reaper to change.</LI>
</UL>
13.06.2004<BR />
Ville:
<UL>
    <LI>Fixed shooting creatures from very
    close. The bullet should hit now.</LI>
    <LI>New option for teleporting, you
    can now choose whether creatures follow you through the teleport.</LI>
    <LI>Dropping plot_objects now uses an
    angle from the creature, check if this causes any trouble.</LI>
    <LI>Map editor should now work.</LI>
    <LI>You can use the map editor to
    precicely set the player starting place on the map. Just place any
    of the creatures mentioned in player_races.dat. They will look funny
    in the editor.</LI>
    <LI>Only the first block of conditions
    in weared items is checked every frame, and if the conditions are
    not met, the item is disabled.</LI>
    <LI>New creature specialty: Cannot
    drop item class</LI>
    <LI>New creature death type: 2=killed
    by player</LI>
    <LI>Added setting for light intensity
    in lights.dat.</LI>
    <LI>New effect: Creature cannot fire
    weapon.</LI>
    <LI>New effect: Change AI tactic.</LI>
    <LI>When you get the game to crash,
    send me the debug.txt</LI>
    <LI>Aliens now avoid terrain marked
    with AI_avoid in terrain_types.dat. This does not work perfectly as
    due to speed issues the pathfinding needs to be turned off for
    creatures that are far from the player. We need to make the aliens
    immune to lava.</LI>
    <LI>I removed the Pistol Chassis and
    the Emergency Rations from the start. They need to be given to the
    player otherwise. I suggest giving the human player some emergency
    rations, more for easy level. 
    </LI>
    <LI>There could be some container/box
    in the start area that would give stuff depending on the player race
    when right-clicked. The human could receive the pistol chassis.</LI>
    <LI>Rain can now have a full blown
    effect/condition list. Check that the heat/damage values of the rain
    are approximately balanced.</LI>
    <LI>Ability to set area lighting in
    climate_types.dat. I also tweaked the default settings a bit.</LI>
    <LI>You can now set a race specific
    day length for the planet rotation. It doesn't affect lighting, but
    it affects temperature and journals.</LI>
    <LI>By default aliens can now have a
    secondary AI. It will not be used by them unless the player can
    charm them. I'm not sure if this fixes the problems with the AI
    followers. If it doesn't, I'm going to need a detailed account of
    how to reproduce the problem.</LI>
    <LI>Shouldn't the alien's claws be
    wieldable?</LI>
    <LI>Fixed a bug when the aliens's
    claws wouldn't sometimes fire.</LI>
    <LI>If the game still crashes when
    exiting, send me the debug.txt.</LI>
</UL>
Quanrian:
<UL>
    <LI>Removed the script for Psionic's
    light and put it in the creatures.dat file instead.</LI>
    <LI>Removed the Quick Key Changes to
    quick change the Psionic Chill to the Psionic Blast and back. This
    was an extra and I may add it back later, but it's not likely.</LI>
    <LI>Temporarily nulled the damage lava
    does so creatures don't die when they walk over it. You will still
    heat up and get slow, just wont lose health. Will re-enable once the
    pathfinding is smart enough to not run through lava to get you,
    killing themselves in the process.</LI>
    <LI>Alien cannot use the Flashlight or
    the Biomass Detector.</LI>
    <LI>Lifeforce Drain now gives you
    Essence instead of directly giving you health. This makes it more
    useful in my opinion as Essence is required for other abilities. It
    also gives you a slight boost in speed, reducing the creature's
    speed you drained life from as well.</LI>
    <LI>The Desert Golem now only has one
    level upgrade but it makes a big difference. You must drop 10
    Essence into fire for it to transform into a larger form which is
    slower, but has twice the health and can turn more quickly. Its
    attack remains the same.</LI>
</UL>
04.06.2004
<UL>
    <LI>New collision detection system.</LI>
    <LI>Had to turn off the collision
    detection when items are created. There was a check when placing any
    item whether it is on an object, and if it was the item was moved.
    Keep an eye out for any problems this may cause.</LI>
    <LI>Should the new shake screen effect
    be used in heat/cold strokes?</LI>
    <LI>The new pathfinding system is in
    place. Try to see if there is any bad behavior such as walking
    straight towards a wall, and take a screenshot of it.</LI>
    <LI>The map editor is not functional
    yet. It is not used in the map creation, although the map sizes are
    taken from it.</LI>
    <LI>It should no longer be possible to
    drop items outside borders.</LI>
    <LI>Terrains are now defined in a
    separate file. You can define effects/conditions for them, and they
    now affect all creatures. This causes a problem for lava, the
    enemies are easily killed by it until I can make the AI avoid it</LI>
    <LI>The lava does not glow yet.</LI>
</UL>
11.05.2004
<UL>
    <LI>Removed detector2.tga and
    combine.jpg</LI>
    <LI>You can now define custom footstep
    sounds for each creature</LI>
    <LI>You can now define an interval for
    each script, long interval for complex conditions, short for
    accuracy.</LI>
    <LI>Creatures can now carry lights.
    </LI>
    <LI>Maybe the player could use a torch
    as the first source of energy, and be later able to build a
    flashlight?</LI>
    <LI>Added the ragdoll system to act as
    the toggling system, items that can be wielded should have only one
    use (one effects block entry)</LI>
    <LI>The game uses the item use
    conditions to disable the wielded items: The flashlight use
    condition checks if there's enough energy, and if there isn't, the
    flashlight is disabled.</LI>
    <LI>Changed the Environment armor a
    bit to suit the new ragdoll, check out if it works</LI>
    <LI>Changed the boots to suit the new
    ragdoll. Check that the speed up amount and the amount of ether
    consumed is OK. 
    </LI>
    <LI>Changed the goggles to use the new
    effect, check that they look OK, and use enough energy</LI>
    <LI>The time descriptions that tell
    the player to use an item, when the item rather should be worn, need
    to be checked</LI>
    <LI>Try to add two handed weapons</LI>
    <LI>I'm not sure how the alien's claws
    should be. He cannot use tools if they're a two handed weapon. I'm
    thinking they shouldn't use a slot at all.</LI>
    <LI>Should psionic's weapons be
    wieldable?</LI>
    <LI>Try to integrate the targeting
    beams to some weapon</LI>
    <LI>Try to think of a place for the
    biomass/items detectors, they should probably use energy and be in a
    slot, but I'm not sure which one</LI>
    <LI>What is the item Welding Torch B?
    Should the name be changed as I cannot discern what the B means.</LI>
    <LI>Should we finally add the breath
    bar?</LI>
    <LI>I've added a description field to
    the creatures.dat creature specialties. The field is not loaded by
    the game, you can use it to remind yourself about what the specialty
    does.</LI>
    <LI>Eat events, Hit events, and death
    Events. There's a sample creature in the end to show you how they
    work. Delete the sample creature once you don't need it anymore.</LI>
    <LI>Maybe some sort of an explosion
    could be triggered when a particularly big robot dies?</LI>
    <LI>Check that growing the alien larva
    works with the new creature event system</LI>
    <LI>See if the growable alien AI
    tactics need tweaking</LI>
    <LI>Check if the new conditions work</LI>
    <LI>Check if the new effects work</LI>
    <LI>Could you see if you could include
    the item using endings from endings.dat to items.dat?</LI>
    <LI>It's now possible to set an
    unbreakable combination. Perhaps a solution for the food replicator
    problem where the player would just carry the heavy replicator by
    breaking it up first.</LI>
    <LI>You can now make plot_objects
    activate by interval. It should allow for a variety of effects, such
    as the 1.1 fungus dispenser.</LI>
    <LI>You can now change the side and
    start area of the player from player_races.dat</LI>
    <LI>The mass of items from the game
    start needs to be simplified. I don't think the player should be
    bothered with the gun chassis, or batteries. If truly needed they
    should be put into the player_races.dat to make them appear in the
    inventory in the game start.</LI>

    <LI>All items that are created in the
    beginning of a map now need to have a trigger event of 3 in the
    plot_object, the item creating effect is no longer automatically
    activated. The plot_object should also be set to vanish once the
    effect is done if the plot_object is not needed after the creation.</LI>
    <LI>Take a look at the new flamer. I'm
    sure some weapons would benefit from giving them more such effects.</LI>
    <LI>Please don't use the eat and death
    events for the creatures, they'll be replaced.</LI>
    <LI>The force field still needs to be
    redone. I'm not sure all the necessary effects are there yet.</LI>
    <LI>The two effects reserved for
    plot_objects don't work. They are the item/plot_object dispensing
    effects.</LI>
    <LI>The flashlight is hard coded at
    the moment, and always stays on. I'm going to make the items
    possible to turn on/off, and use that in the flashlight.</LI>
    <LI>There's still a lot to be done
    with the sounds. For example the cold/heat sounds are off, and the
    fires no longer make any sound. I'm going to make a way for a
    plot_object to emit a constant sound, so that could be used for the
    fires.</LI>
    <LI>It is not good that the dropped
    food generator looks just like the deployed generator. Ideas on how
    to change this?</LI>

    <LI>item list sorting should be stable
    now, no longer swaps when you use something</LI>
    <LI>new AI, check the AI modes and see
    if you can think of any new ones</LI>
    <LI>sneaking up on anyone is darn
    difficult now</LI>
    <LI>I'm afraid the teleporting cannot
    be to a random area</LI>
    <LI>effect drop creature at start is
    supposed to destroy the plot_object, just like the item seeder does</LI>
    <LI>fixed healing to top off at
    maximum and 0</LI>
    <LI>effects are now ordered
    differently:</LI>
    <LI>  each effect can have multiple
    requirements</LI>
    <LI>  each effect can have multiple
    subeffects</LI>
    <LI>  list of subeffects is gone
    throught from top to bottom</LI>
    <LI>  if one fails, such as cannot
    reduce item because no item exists, the rest of the subeffects will
    be discarded (should no longer need item requirements for item
    reducers)</LI>
    <LI>  rearranged all that have multiple
    effects: check that they work</LI>
    <LI>restructuring of the weapon
    damage/effect system, we now have a separate entry for what happens
    when a weapon is fired, what happens when the bullet hits, and what
    conditions are required to equip and fire the weapon (note: you
    should have a condition to require a bullet if the weapon uses a
    bullet)</LI>
    <LI>due to the new AI it's now very
    difficult to find the buried vines in the eden, any suggestions?
    Should they perhaps have a lower tolerance for attacking you?</LI>
    <LI>restructuring of the bar system:</LI>
    <LI>  please list any discrepancies
    with the bars you can find, and fix them if they can be fixed
    without code changes. I've spent some 20 hours working the bars last
    week, and I'm bound to have forgotten something.</LI>
    <LI>there now is a debug mode, you can
    activate it by setting the first value (after the -) in
    data/setup.dat to 1. Now the game will create a debug.txt every time
    you run it.</LI>
    <LI>at the moment the player cannot

    <LI>can now exclude item classes from
    player use (example = android cannot eat)</LI>
    <LI>can now exclude plot_objects by
    class (just list one number per row in areas.dat)</LI>
    <LI>creatures can now be immune to
    weapon classes, maybe we should use this in some creatures?</LI>
    <LI>no more infinite pulse beacons</LI>
    <LI>no more item drop crash (here's
    the description from the forum): 
    </LI>
    <LI>  Okay, about the
    crashing-when-dropping-stuff bug: This is how</LI>
    <LI>  to reproduce it:</LI>
    <LI>  Click the last item in your
    inventory, so it's picked up as if</LI>
    <LI>  you were going to combine it with
    something. Now press 'd' to</LI>
    <LI>  drop it. Drop it (all of it, if
    it's stacked). Now notice that</LI>
    <LI>  the name of the item is still on
    your cursor. Press 'd' on</LI>
    <LI>  another item. Notrium will crash.</LI>
    <LI>save and load menus now have
    titles</LI>
    <LI>you can now precise place
    creatures with the plot_objects, just use the effect number 52</LI>
    <LI>game should no longer crash when
    player dies while combining items</LI>
    <LI>you should now be able to pick up
    items that are on teleporters</LI>
    <LI>whole concept of use time was
    removed, too much work to properly do it</LI>
