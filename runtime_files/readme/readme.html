    <P class="intended_text">
    Notrium is a realtime single player survival game. You control a spaceship crew member
    who has crashed on a strange planet filled with aliens, and your job is to
    get home alive. You find alien items on the planet surface which you can
    combine with others to make all sorts of useful gadgets and weapons. The game
    can be completed in several different ways, and it has a high replay value.
    </P>

    <P class="intended_text">
    Surviving in the world of Notrium is not an easy job. See the <a href="#HOW_TO_PLAY">Survival Guide</a> if you
    need help. Have fun playing!

    This is the abridged version. Marine, keep this guide with you always in case you suddenly find yourself
    shipwrecked on a hostile planet!

    <P class="intended_text">
    <STRONG>What to do when stranded on an alien planet?</strong><BR />
    The first thing to do is to check your immediate surroundings for anything useful, and to
    find out what necessary survival gear you already have. Collect everything you find by
    right clicking the items.
    </P>
    <P class="intended_text">
    <STRONG>Character classes</strong><BR />
    Marines are chosen from four species: The very rare Humans, the common Aliens, the manufactured Androids, and the mysterious Psionics.
    <UL type="disc">
        <LI>Humans<BR />-Weak and fragile. Easily hurt by cold and heat. Best suited for suicide missions.</LI>
        <LI>Aliens<BR />-Compared to humans are faster and stronger. The only drawback is that they cannot wear weapons, and must only use their claws.</LI>
        <LI>Androids<BR />-Very high resistance to both damage and temperature. They do not require food to survive, but constantly use battery energy to operate.</LI>
        <LI>Psionics<BR />-These weird little critters use their mind to attack and command their enemies. Their bright mind illuminates their surroundings.</LI>

        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Body Temperature</strong><BR />
        The topmost meter shows your body temperature. You will get warmer when you stay in the sun during the day,
        and when you get too hot you will have a heat stroke. To avoid getting too hot, stay in the shade of a tree
        by days. On nights you will get cold, and to avoid getting frozen you must stay near a fire. Fires can be found near
        crash sites, and you can eventually make some of your own.
        </P>
        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Food</strong><BR />
        The yellow meter in the middle shows how much food is in your stomach. If you run out of food you will starve, and lose health.
        Finding food on an alien planet can be difficult, try right clicking anything that looks edible.
        </P>
        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Health</strong><BR />
        The lowest red meter shows your health. When you run low on health, you should find local herbs or doctors to heal your wounds.

        <STRONG>Battery</strong><BR />
        The blue meter shows how much energy your battery has left. Weapon use will drain your battery,
        and you will want to build a recharging station as soon as possible. Energy may be scarce if you
        have crashed on an uncivilized planet, so don't waste your shots.
        </P>
        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Tazor</strong><BR />
        All Escape Pods are equipped with the standard issue Tazor #D21, a stunning weapon that
        is effective against most alien races. It is not likely that the weapon can kill, so
        you should be safe against murder charges on alien worlds. Remember, The Space Navy will not
        defend you in any court outside Artus prime.

        <STRONG>Using items</strong><BR />
        Your inventory computer keeps a list of the items you have. When you want to use an item you have picked
        up, press I-key to activate the inventory, select the item from the list and press U-key. Notice that 
        using some items may make them unusable for other purposes.

        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Combining items</strong><BR />
        When stranded on an alien planet you will need to build some things you cannot find, for example weapons.
        You can combine items together by selecting the part from the list, then clicking on the part 
        you wish to combine it with. Not all parts go together. If you wish to break down an item to its components, simply select the
        item and press B-key.

        <STRONG>Item Weight</strong><BR />
        Marine, altough we've trained you to carry items like a mule, you may occasionally find it impossible
        to carry everything with you. Carrying over your carry limit will slow you down, so drop unnecessary
        items at a safe place.

        Certain items such as weapon and armor use slots.
        When you equip a slotted item, you will see it appear on the right side of the screen.
        You can also wield/unwield slotted items by dragging them to the proper slot.
        If you are for example wielding a two-handed weapon, you cannot use the flashlight, since the slot is already taken.
        </P>
        <P class="intended_text">
        <STRONG>Energy Usage</strong><BR />
        Many slotted items such as the flashlight and the item detector use battery energy when wielded.

    After installing a mod you can choose to play it from the new game menu.

    <P class="intended_text">
    If you are interested in modding the game, we have an excellent community of modders at the <A href="http://www.monkkonen.net/forum.php">forum</A> to help you out.
    There are two main tools:
    </P>

    <P class="intended_text">
    <b>The map editor</b><br />
    The map editor ships with the game.
    It is a hidden feature, and you can activate it by editing the setup.dat file in the Notrium/data folder.
    Set the flag "create game initialization debug file" to 1, and you will see the map editor button appear in the new game menu within the game.
    You can find out the main keys of the editor by pressing F1.
